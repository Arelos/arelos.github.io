## Arelos Website-Next
This is the upcoming website for Arelos and is soon going to replace our current excuse of
a website.

## Credits

This website is based on the open-source web template by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com) and we would like that all credits go to them for making an amazing template that's also Open-Source!

This website is built almost entirely around the [Bootstrap Framework](https://getbootstrap.com) and such amazing and responsive sites would not have been possible without the Bootstrap Framework!
