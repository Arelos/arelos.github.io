# Arelos Website
This is *the new* website for Arelos and has replaced our old excuse of
a website.

## Installation and Contributing
Installation is fairly simple as the site only utilizes basic JS and JQuery plugins and does not require any installation of Bower, Gulp, Ruby, Grunt and the like. Just Clone, do some things and submit a Pull Request and we will gladly look at it!

## Credits

This website is based on the open-source web template by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com) and we would like that all credits go to them for making an amazing template that's also Open-Source!

This website is built almost entirely around the [Twitter Bootstrap Framework](https://getbootstrap.com) and such amazing and responsive sites would not have been possible without the Bootstrap Framework!
